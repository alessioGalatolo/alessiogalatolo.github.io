    excerpt: "I am a second-year PhD student at the Social Robotics Lab, Uppsala University. I obtained my Master's in Machine Learning at KTH, Sweden in 2022. My master's thesis was in the field of social robotics where I explored the incorporation of emotions and personality into a conversational social agent. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science with honours at the University of Pisa, Italy. My bachelor's thesis investigated the use of whole positive numbers in the traditional switching theory with applications e.g. in the field of data mining. "
